## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows dataset. Using PostgreSQL 17 and pgAdmin, I explored the Netflix catalog to uncover meaningful insights about content distribution, ratings, regional trends, and genre patterns. The project showcases practical SQL skills including data manipulation, aggregation, string functions, and complex querying techniques essential for data analyst roles.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows) on Netflix
- Identify the most common ratings for different content types
- Investigate content based on release years, countries, and durations
- Explore content added in recent years and identify trends
- Categorize and filter content based on specific criteria and keywords
- Extract insights about directors, actors, and genres

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about Netflix's movies and TV shows:

- **Dataset Link:** [Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)
- **Dataset Description:** Contains details about Netflix titles including type, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, genre, and description

## Schema
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;

CREATE TABLE netflix (
    show_id      VARCHAR(6),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(150),
    director     VARCHAR(208),
    casts        VARCHAR(1000),
    country      VARCHAR(150),
    date_added   VARCHAR(50),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(10),

    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,

FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```

### 3. List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)

## Findings and Conclusion

Through this analysis, I discovered several key insights about Netflix's content library:

- **Content Distribution:** The dataset reveals a diverse collection of movies and TV shows, with distinct patterns in how content is categorized and distributed across different types.
- **Rating Patterns:** The most common ratings analysis provides valuable insights into Netflix's target audience demographics and content strategy.
- **Geographic Trends:** The analysis of top countries producing content and India's content release patterns over the years highlights regional content preferences and Netflix's global expansion strategy.
